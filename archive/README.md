# Getting Started with tree-frog app

## What is this app, and what's with the frog? I can't find any here.
`Last year at 19 july` I had a pretty serious bike accident during training on enduro bike in the forest.
As a result my field of view (among others) was damaged. Because before the accident,
I was working as a frontend developer, I decided to create an app that will help me (and others, since this is and will be publicly available)
in eye training, that I am doing almost every day.

## Ok, but why it is called that way? What's with the frog?

once I was in primary school, we were participating in a test to check iur field of view. 
And since a friend of mine was the son of an ophthalmologist, he wanted to get the highest score. To get it he cheated,
in a pretty funny way. When we checked the results, we were astonished - he had a better field of view than a tree frog...
I recently remembered this story, and I thought - that's it! This app will help me to have a similar field of view like him.
That would be a very interesting skill.
